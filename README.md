# Decision_Tree
Constructed a decision tree on training data and predicted on test data, using python 3.6.
However, the former versions of python should also be able to use.
To call my code, (in Windows) first cd the directory and then type in: python dt-learn.py credit_train.arff credit_test.arff m

The output is of the following form:

Decision Tree displayed//

Predicted label for each test sample displayed//

Total number of correct predictions over all the test sample//

Also, there are another two parts which are commented, for Learning Curve and ROC Curve.
